# Text Generataion with Markov Chains


In this project, I learnt about Markov chains and used them to build a probabilistic model of an entire bookâ€™s text.

Markov chains are a simple but fundamental approach to modeling stochastic processes, with many practical applications.  In the end, I generated a random new text based on the book Grimm.
