# Machine Learning with Python

## About
This is the ninth of the ten Courses in the certification. 

This course provides an overview of the purpose of Machine Learning, and where it applies to the real world. It then covers topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and various useful Machine Learning algorithms.

To explore the methods of machine learning, and the algorithms involved, many example projects are embarked upon and explored, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, and recommendation engines.

It teaches the following algorithms:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

Further, following machine learning models are learnt and tested upon:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score
