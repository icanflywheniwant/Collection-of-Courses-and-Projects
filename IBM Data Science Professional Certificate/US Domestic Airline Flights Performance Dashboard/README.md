# Data Visualization with Python

## About
This is the eight of the ten Courses in the certification. 

This course teaches various Data Visualization tools and techniques. This course makes use of several Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium, to explore Canadian immigration data. It also covers dashboard creation using Plotly Dash, with a final assignment combining the skills learned to analyse and report US domestic airline flights performance in a dashboard.

The certificates earned and the work I performed for the completion of this course are uploaded here.
