# Climate Geospatial Analysis on Python with Xarray

In this project, I will load, visualize, manipulate and perform both simple and grouped operations over geospatial multidimensional data through Xarray and Python.

   $$
    Load and getting familiar with NetCDF datasets
    Select and filter data through coordinates
    Visualize multidimensional and geospatial variables
    Apply simple operations over multidimensional data
    Apply grouped operations over multidimensional data
    Merge and concatenate datasets
    Interact with Pandas and export datasets
