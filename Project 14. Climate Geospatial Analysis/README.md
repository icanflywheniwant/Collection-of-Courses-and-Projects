## Learning Objectives

- By the end of this project, you will be able to load, visualize, manipulate and perform both simple and grouped operations over geospatial multidimensional data through Xarray and Python.  
- We'll explore an dataset containing temperature, vegetation density and total precipitation over the Brazilian Amazon for the 1979-2019 period while the concepts are developed. 
- This will enable the learner to handle and extract knowledge from complex datasets such as the ones from satellite and climate re-analysis. observations.
