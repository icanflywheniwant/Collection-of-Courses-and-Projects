In this project we will predict titanic survivors’ using logistic regression and naïve bayes classifiers.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the key sad tragedies in history and it took place on April 15th, 1912. The numbers of survivors were low due to lack of lifeboats for all passengers. In this portoflio project, I will analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy with the power of machine learning.
