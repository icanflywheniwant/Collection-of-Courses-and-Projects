## The following tasks were performed by me to perform a EDA with Pandas:

1. Task 1: Initial Data Exploration
2. Task 2: Univariate Analysis
3. Task 3: Bivariate Analysis
4. Task 4: Dealing With Duplicate Rows and Missing Values
5. Task 5: Correlation Analysis


#### It is to be noted that a Similar Project has been performed by me during the IBM Data Science Certification and this project is meant for practice.
