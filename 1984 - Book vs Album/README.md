This is a fun project that was carried out whereby I leveraged the George Orwell novel, 1984 and compared it 1984, the sixth studio album by Van Halen (Rock Band), to explore the NLP Techniques of :

1. Summarizing text
2. Sentiment analysis
3. Word Clouds

A similar project of analysing the sentinment on Twitter using NLP was also undertaken by me.
