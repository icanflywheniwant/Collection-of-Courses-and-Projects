## About

<br>

The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction/">Machine Learning Specialization</a> is a foundational online program created in collaboration between DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. This program teaches the fundamentals of machine learning and how to use these techniques to build real-world AI applications. 

The following topics were covered in depth during the duration of this course:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.

- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression.

- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.

- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.

- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.

- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.

- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.

- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
